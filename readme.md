# My Game

I made this game during Winter break after my very first semester of my program.

It is not complete, and there's a good chance it never will be...

If you would like to play what I do have run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/Aamon-Magnusson/Game.git
cd Game # or whatever you called the directory
make
./Game
```

From there enjoy the Game.

(I do know this is programmed terribly, that's why I don't want to finish it. It would be better the restart in python, but I don't want to do that either)
